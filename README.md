# Python-Project_Data_Visualization_on_HoneyDataset
Description
This Python project explores a dataset related to honey production, focusing on various aspects such as distribution, relationships between variables, and correlation analysis. It involves data visualization using popular libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights into honey production trends.

Tasks Completed
Import Required Libraries and Read Dataset: Essential libraries are imported, and the dataset is read into the environment.

Data Exploration: Initial exploration includes examining the first few samples, shape, and info of the data to understand different features.

Percentage Distribution by Year: The percentage distribution of the data in each year is visualized using a pie chart.

Distribution of "Price per lb": The distribution of the variable "price per lb" is visualized using a distribution plot (displot), with findings documented.

Relationship between 'numcol' and 'prodvalue': The relationship between the variables 'numcol' and 'prodvalue' is explored through a scatterplot, with findings documented.

Relationship between 'year' and 'prodvalue': The relationship between the categorical variable 'year' and the numerical variable 'prodvalue' is visualized through a boxplot, with findings documented.

Relationship between Multiple Variables Across Years: The relationship between multiple pairs of variables throughout different years is explored using pairplot, focusing on columns 'numcol', 'yield percol', 'total prod', 'prodvalue', and 'year'.

Correlation Analysis: Correlation values between specific variables are displayed using a plot, with inferences added. Columns used for correlation analysis include 'numcol', 'yield percol', 'total prod', 'stocks', 'price per lb', and 'prodvalue'.
